ASP.NET Web API is a framework that makes it easy to build HTTP services that reach a broad range of clients, including browsers and mobile devices. ASP.NET Web API is an ideal platform for building RESTful applications on the .NET Framework.

When you're building APIs on the Web, there are several ways you can build APIs on the Web. These include HTTP/RPC, and what this means is using HTTP in Remote Procedure Call to call into things, like Methods, across the Web.

The verbs themselves are included in the APIs, like Get Customers, Insert Invoice, Delete Customer, and that each of these endpoints end up being a separate URI.
